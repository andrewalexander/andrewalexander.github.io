It was the first thing Andrew cooked for Tiyrah that actually impressed her. It remains a delicacy in the AF household. Even if you don&rsquo;t like quinoa or think that ground turkey has no place in meatloaf, you will be amazed by this dish. It says it serves 2-4&hellip; Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to stop ourselves. Your results may vary.</p>
<p><strong>Things to watch out for/take note of:</strong></p>
<p>People may try to wife you up after the first bite. Stay alert.</p>
<p>Wash the quinoa! We went so long without knowing this and dealt with bitter quinoa&hellip; and still rather enjoyed it&hellip; Don&rsquo;t do it to yourself. Enjoy it right. We use a mesh strainer and it works well.</p>
<p>Cook the quinoa a bit ahead of time since you want to let it cool a bit once cooked.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1/4 cup dry quinoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/2 cup water (or chicken stock/broth)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp olive oil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 small onion, chopped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 16-20oz package ground turkey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp tomato paste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tbsp hot sauce - Frank&rsquo;s or Crystal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tbsp worcestershire sauce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 egg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 and 1/2 tsp salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp ground black pepper, to taste
<em>for the sauce/coating on top:</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tbsp brown sugar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 tsp worcestershire sauce (separate from above!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 tsp water (or less)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the washed/rinsed quinoa and water/stock/broth to a boil. Once there, cover and reduce to low, simmering for 15-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed, the quinoa is tender and the little spirals are popping out. Set aside.</li>
<li>Get the oven preheated while you wait for things to cool down. 350F.</li>
<li>Get some olive oil going in a skillet. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, but not browned. About 5 minutes or less. Add garlic, cooking until fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside to cool as well.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, add the ground turkey, tomato paste, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons of the worcestershire (not the smaller amount reserved for the sauce later), egg, salt, pepper, the cooked quinoa, and the onion/garlic mixture. Mix well and place it into a greased or parchment lined loaf pan.</li>
<li>Make the coating in a small bowl - Combine the 2 tbsp of brown sugar with the 2 tsp (smaller amount) of worcestershire sauce and drop in a bit of the 1 tsp of water. Mix well and spread across the top of the meatloaf in the pan.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven for about 50 minutes - a meat thermometer poked into the middle should read 160.</li>
<li>Let it cool for 5-10 minutes! If you slice into too soon, a lot of the moisture will be lost to the pan. Though it is still quite good if this happens. We have been guilty of this more than a few times.</li>
</ol>
