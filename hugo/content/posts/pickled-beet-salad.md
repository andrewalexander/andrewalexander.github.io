This has no business being as good as it is for how simple and quick it is to make. Seriously. We didn't even know if we liked pickled beets but after this... we are convinced. The feta complements the beet and balsamic flavor perfectly. 

**Things to watch out for/take note of:**

Pickled beets are hard to find sometimes. Look near pickles and olives in the grocery store. Make sure to get them sliced or do a lot more slicing later. 

The beets will stain everything... so try not to use a wooden cutting board you like very much unless it's covered in plastic wrap or parchment paper or something. 

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 8 grape tomatoes, halved
- 8 sliced pickled beets, halved
- 4 cups baby arugula (or grown up arugula, we don't discriminate)
- 1/2 tsp or salt (or more, to taste)
- 1/4 feta cheese

**Directions:**

1. Mix the balsamic and olive oil in a small bowl
2. Throw everything but the feta in a bowl and mix it all up
3. Top each serving with feta (though you can also just mix it in with everything, we won't tell) and enjoy!
