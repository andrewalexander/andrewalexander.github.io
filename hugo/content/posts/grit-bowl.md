This is a go-to we eat literally every week. Sometimes multiple times a week. It will keep us both full for hours, and is something we make when we know it will be a long day. It's not _too_ prep-heavy but if cutting up onions and garlic really is too much to do in the AM, some granulated onion and garlic can be substituted in with decent success. 

**Things to watch out for/take note of:**

Don't burn the bacon. This happens far too often for either one of us to admit. 

We like to use turkey bacon but typical pork bacon is obviously fine too.

You can mix it up by adding some potatoes/hash browns, or using sausage instead of bacon. Or both!

The steps look like a lot, but it goes really quick.

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 onion - yellow or white, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup grits
- 2 cups water
- 1tsp/pinch of chicken boiullon
- 4 strips of bacon (or 5... or 6...)
- 4 eggs 
- 2 tsp Vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp Butter
- 2 tsp Olive Oil
- Cracked black pepper

**Directions:**

1. Put the bacon into an air fryer or heat up a skillet to pan fry them. They should take about 12 minutes in the air fryer, turning once.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a sauce pan on high heat; once hot, add the onions and sautee until a color starts to appear.
3. Add the garlic, wait until fragrant, then add the pinch of chicken boiullon.
4. Stir to let the flavors get to know each other briefly, then add the water.
4. While the water comes to boil, tend your bacon and make sure it doesn't burn.
5. With the water boiling, stir in the grits to be sure they don't clump up. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 5-6 minutes. Check on that bacon again... remove it once it's actually done and totally not burnt.
6. Get a pad of butter (about a tbsp) and a splash of olive oil (about a teaspoon) heated into a non-stick pan.
7. Scramble the eggs once the butter melts. Mix constantly to get a smaller, runnier curd, about 2-3 minutes.
8. When the eggs are done to your liking, remove from heat.
9. Chop up the cooked bacon into small bits. Cutting 2-3 times lengthwise and then chopping sideways seems to yield the best results.
10. Combine everything! Put the base of grits down into a bowl, sprinkle the chopped bacon in, and add the eggs on top. Sprinkle some freshly cracked pepper to complete the meal.
