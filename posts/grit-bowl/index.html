It will keep us both full for hours, and is something we make when we know it will be a long day. It&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> prep-heavy but if cutting up onions and garlic really is too much to do in the AM, some granulated onion and garlic can be substituted in with decent success.</p>
<p><strong>Things to watch out for/take note of:</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t burn the bacon. This happens far too often for either one of us to admit.</p>
<p>We like to use turkey bacon but typical pork bacon is obviously fine too.</p>
<p>You can mix it up by adding some potatoes/hash browns, or using sausage instead of bacon. Or both!</p>
<p>The steps look like a lot, but it goes really quick.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 onion - yellow or white, diced</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>1/2 cup grits</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1tsp/pinch of chicken boiullon</li>
<li>4 strips of bacon (or 5&hellip; or 6&hellip;)</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>2 tsp Vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
<li>2 tsp Olive Oil</li>
<li>Cracked black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Put the bacon into an air fryer or heat up a skillet to pan fry them. They should take about 12 minutes in the air fryer, turning once.</li>
<li>Heat the vegetable oil in a sauce pan on high heat; once hot, add the onions and sautee until a color starts to appear.</li>
<li>Add the garlic, wait until fragrant, then add the pinch of chicken boiullon.</li>
<li>Stir to let the flavors get to know each other briefly, then add the water.</li>
<li>While the water comes to boil, tend your bacon and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t burn.</li>
<li>With the water boiling, stir in the grits to be sure they don&rsquo;t clump up. Reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 5-6 minutes. Check on that bacon again&hellip; remove it once it&rsquo;s actually done and totally not burnt.</li>
<li>Get a pad of butter (about a tbsp) and a splash of olive oil (about a teaspoon) heated into a non-stick pan.</li>
<li>Scramble the eggs once the butter melts. Mix constantly to get a smaller, runnier curd, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>When the eggs are done to your liking, remove from heat.</li>
<li>Chop up the cooked bacon into small bits. Cutting 2-3 times lengthwise and then chopping sideways seems to yield the best results.</li>
<li>Combine everything! Put the base of grits down into a bowl, sprinkle the chopped bacon in, and add the eggs on top. Sprinkle some freshly cracked pepper to complete the meal.</li>
</ol>
